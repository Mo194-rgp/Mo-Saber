      <div class="text">
        <p> .Bu Fihr Mahmud ibn Muhammad Shakir (1327–1418 AH/1909–97 AD) was a renowned Arabic scholar, Egyptian researcher, and prolific writer. He developed a unique approach to literary study and appreciation of Arabic expression, both poetry and prose, in what he called "the method of appreciation," and to the study of linguistic, literary, and legal heritage. He was renowned for his originality and rigor in defending Arabic and confronting waves of Westernization.He fought many literary battles regarding the authenticity of Arab culture and the sources of pre-Islamic poetry. He won the King Faisal International Prize. His students and acquaintances called him the Sheikh of Arabic. He is the brother of the distinguished scholar and verifier Ahmad Muhammad Shakir, and the cousin of the scholar and verifier Abd al-Salam HarunSheikh Mahmoud Shaker was raised in a religious environment. His brothers did not receive a secular education, but he, being the youngest of his brothers, devoted himself to a secular education. He received his early education at Al-Walda Umm Abbas School in Cairo in 1916, then, after the 1919 revolution, he moved to Al-Qarbia School in Darb Al-Jammamiz. There, he was greatly influenced by English lessons because of their interest in it and because it was new to him.Since he spent a lot of time at Al-Azhar Mosque, he heard poetry even though he didn’t know what poetry was!! It is worth mentioning that he memorized the entire collection of poems by Al-Mutanabbi during that period. In 1921, he entered the Khedivial Secondary School to join the science department and become interested in studying mathematics. After completing high school - and despite his love for mathematics and his proficiency in English - he preferred to join the college ofHe joined the Arabic Language Department at the Faculty of Arts, recognizing the importance of the "word" in the ancient history of his nation and its inevitable role in its future. Because he was enrolled in the science department, he was initially unable to enter the Faculty of Arts. However, through Taha Hussein's mediation with Ahmed Lutfi al-Sayyid, the then president of the Egyptian University, he was able to enroll in the program he desired in 1926.
He left university. At university, Shaker listened to Taha Hussein's lectures on pre-Islamic poetry, which became known as the book "On Pre-Islamic Poetry." He was shocked when Taha Hussein claimed that pre-Islamic poetry was fabricated and that it was a lie, not told by the likes of Imru' al-Qais and Zuhair, but rather invented by narrators in the Islamic era.The shock was compounded by the fact that what he heard from the great lecturer he had previously read in full in an Orientalist magazine, in an article by the English Orientalist Margoliouth.
The lectures on this subject continued, and our friend was unable to confront Taha Hussein with what was in his heart, and his dignity and politeness prevented him from standing up and discussing with his professor. He remained like that for a while, unable to speak, until he ran out of patience and endurance. He stood up and responded to Taha Hussein frankly and without dissimulation, but he was unable to confront him with the fact that what he was saying was nothing but a shameless and indifferent plagiarism of Margoliouth’s ideasThe lectures on this subject continued, and our friend was unable to confront Taha Hussein with what was in his heart, and his dignity and politeness prevented him from standing up and discussing with his professor.
